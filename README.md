# RailsOpentracer

This gem instruments an application to be used with a tracing client. At this stage it is configured to be used with Zipkin only, but
this can be changed at a later stage. While there are other gems that offer very similar functionality, the idea here was to instrument
an application with OpenTracing with the absolute minimum amount of instrumentation/configuration.

TODO:
- Investigate performance impact
- Investigate cause of lone .js spans

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_opentracer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To run Zipkin locally, do:

  $ docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin

You will need to set an environment variable with the Zipkin client URL. Locally this would be:

`ENV['ZIPKIN_SERVICE_URL']='http://localhost:9411'`, and

`ENV['RAILS_OPENTRACER_ENABLED']='yes'`.

Whenever a request is made to another application, do:

```ruby
include RailsOpentracer
```

in the applicable controller, and then:

```ruby
with_span 'name of span' do
  get(URL)
end
```

Devlopment of this gem has leaned heavily on Iaintshine's (https://github.com/iaintshine) work.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
